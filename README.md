##Description
Micro turns from 0 to 180 degree. It steps by 5 degree. The MicroServ delays after every step. Each step adds more to the time it delays (10ms). When the angle is 180 degree the microserv turns to 0 degree. Anytime it receives "stop" from serial port it stops until anything else comes from the serial port.
